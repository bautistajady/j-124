"Is it rude to say more than a few words to the stranger sitting next to you on a plane?"

I chose to do the data regarding whether or not people find it rude to make conversations with strangers you're sitting with. I chose this dataset out of the others because it was a little less predictable than the other opinions. 

I felt like there wasn't really a general convention for this kind of opinion so I was curious to see what the data showed for this. This chart shows that a larger majority of flyers believe that it isn't a bother, whereas a small subset of group did.

I added the total population to contrast each section of the data compared to it's whole counterpart.
